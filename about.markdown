Hello! My name is Arindrajit Basu. I currently work as a Research Manager at the Centre for Internet Society in Bangalore, India. I am a lawyer by training and hold a BA, LLB (Hons) degree from the National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata, and an LLM in public international law from the University of Cambridge, U.K.

This website is meant to house research and other published outputs that I have worked on. Information and updates about my work can be found on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/basuarindrajit) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/arindrajit.basu) profiles.
